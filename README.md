## Description

Find issues for trending GitHub repositories and contribute to open-source projects. The Daily Issue is a web-based application that scrapes live data from GitHub in combination with retrieving repository information from the GitHub API. Data is live updated to reflect daily trends.

## How to Use The Daily Issue

We're always up to date on the daily trending repository list from GitHub. To retrieve the latest list, just refresh the page. The Daily Issue will fetch twenty five trending repositories. Click on a repository card in the main section under "Trending". The repo information dashboard will populate on the right. You'll find general information about the repository listed here.
